# IoTracker Java
## IoTracker is a second year university project designed to keep track of internet of things devices.
This is the Java side of it, programmed by myself. If memory serves correct, this gets statistics from the device and uploads them. The [website](https://github.com/RobJTaylor/IoTracker) then takes over for sorting and displaying. We didn't have to get real device data, but where's the fun in using fake data? We demoed this on a Raspberry Pi during a presentation.
